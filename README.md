# Naive implementation of NLP model Word2Vec

Naive implementation of Word2Vec with:

* negative sampling
* stochastic gradient descent
* most similar words finding function
* no pytorch/tf, only numpy

Usage: for educational purpose and fun :) For production there are many fast and cool solutions (Gensim for example).
